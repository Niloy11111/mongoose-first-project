}

/* some important note about class
super() is being callled in chindlren to send data to parents.
so here Error is Parent and AppError is childrend
-- message goes to super .
  this.statusCode = statusCode; this set as normally classes do.
  and if stack there then   this.stack = stack;

  so we get meesage,statsuCode,stack
